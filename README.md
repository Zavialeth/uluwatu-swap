# UluwatuSwap – V3 Mini DEX

> ⚠️ **Educational Project – Not a Production DEX**  
> UluwatuSwap is a **learning project** built to explore the mechanics of a decentralized exchange (DEX) using SushiSwap V3 smart contracts on Arbitrum.  
> This is **not a serious or production-ready DEX** and should **not** be used for commercial purposes.

## 🚀 Overview

UluwatuSwap is a lightweight **V3 Mini DEX** that allows users to:

- Swap **ETH ↔ DeFiD** (a meme token created by [ZavialETH](https://github.com/Zavialeth)).
- Add liquidity to the ETH/DeFiD pool.
- Collect fees or fully exit liquidity positions.

The liquidity pool leverages **SushiSwap V3 infrastructure** on Arbitrum One.  
The goal of this project is to **learn and experiment** with modern DeFi tooling such as:
- SushiSwap V3 smart contracts
- Wagmi & Web3Modal for wallet connections
- React + Vite for frontend development
